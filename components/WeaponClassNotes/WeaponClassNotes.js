        <p>
          An assault rifle is a short, compact, selective-fire weapon that fires
          a cartridge (typically either 5.56mm or 7.62mm) that has more power
          than a pistol or submachine gun but less power than a standard rifle
          or battle rifle. An assault rifle is designed for medium to long range
          engagements however it will perform well in CQB depending on the
          agents skill.
        </p>

        <p>
          Assault rifles are either a standard configuration with the magazine
          located in front of the pistol grip, or a "bullpup" with the magazine
          located behind the pistol grip of the weapon. Assault rifles can also
          be fitted with a range of attachments including extended magazines,
          sights, fore-grips and muzzle attachments, like a suppressor.

        <p>
          A light machine gun (LMG) is a light-weight weapon designed to be
          operated by a single agent as a support weapon. LMGs generally include
          a larger magazine, a heavier barrel to resist overheating, a more
          robust mechanism to support sustained fire and a bipod. They are also
          designed to be fired from the hip or on the move as a form of
          suppressive fire intended to pin down the enemy. Typically they are
          best suited to a support fire role at medium to long range.
        </p>

        <p>
          LMGs fire smaller caliber rounds than a heavy machine gun and, as
          such, tend to be belt-fed (from a container attached to the gun) or
          from a detachable high-capacity drum magazine. They can also be fitted
          with a range of attachments including sights, fore-grips and muzzle
          attachments, like a suppressor.

          The marksman rifle class covers both designated marksman rifle (DMR)
          weapons and sniper rifles. A DMR is a modern scoped high-precision
          rifle used by agents in the designated marksman (DM) role. A sniper
          rifle is a high-precision, long-range rifle. Requirements include
          accuracy, reliability, mobility, concealment and optics for
          anti-personnel, anti-materiel and surveillance uses. The modern sniper
          rifle is a portable shoulder-fired weapon system with a choice between
          bolt-action or semi-automatic action, fitted with a telescopic sight
          for extreme accuracy and chambered for a high-ballistic performance
          center-fire cartridge. The class is best suited to the support fire at
          long range role.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most DMRs are based on modified designs of an assault rifle and
          usually come with a longer barrel and the ability to mount larger,
          long-range sights. All DMRs in use today are semi-automatic, some with
          select fire. Sniper rifles are generally bolt-action rifles, but can
          also be semi-automatic. Both weapon systems can mount a range of
          attachments including sights, fore-grips and muzzle attachments like a
          suppressor.

          A pistol is a handgun, more specifically one with the chamber integral
          to its gun barrel. A pistol may be a revolver style, semi-automatic or
          fully automatic with a detachable magazine. A pistol provides a close
          range protection option that an agent can utilise in the event of a
          main weapon stoppage or malfunction. Pistols can also be fitted with a
          range of attachments including sights, fore-grips and muzzle
          attachments, like a suppressor.

          A rifle is a long-barreled firearm designed for accurate shooting,
          with a barrel that has a pattern of grooves (rifling) cut into the
          bore wall. In keeping with their focus on accuracy, rifles are
          typically designed to be held with both hands and braced firmly
          against the shooter's shoulder via a butt stock for stability during
          shooting. Most rifles are either single shot lever action which
          requires manual cycling of the weapon after each shot or
          semi-automatic where a shot is fired with each trigger pull without
          the weapon needing to be reloaded manually after each shot is fired.
          Rifles are suited to medium to long range fire.

          Rifles can be fitted with extended magazines and a range of

        <p>
          A shotgun is a long-barreled firearm designed to shoot a
          straight-walled cartridge, which usually discharges numerous small
          pellet-like sub-projectiles, or sometimes a single solid projectile
          called a slug. Shotguns are most commonly smoothbore firearms, meaning
          that their gun barrels have no rifling on the inner wall, but rifled
          barrels for shooting slugs (slug barrels) are also available. Shotguns
          also come in a range of different action types, both single-shot and
          repeating. For non-repeating designs, break action shotguns are by far
          the most common variant. Most modern repeating shotguns are either
          pump-action or semi-automatic, and can also be fully automatic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shotguns are very effective at close range which makes them ideal for
          use in urban combat environments. When compared to handguns, shotguns
          are heavier, larger, and not as maneuverable in close quarters, but do
          have several advantages including that they are generally much more
          powerful, they allow an agent to engage multiple targets faster than
          with a handgun and a shotgun is generally perceived as more
          intimidating.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shotguns can be fitted with a range of attachments including including
          sights, fore-grips and muzzle attachments, like a suppressor. Some
          models can be fitted with a drum magazine.

        <p>
          A submachine gun (SMG) is a magazine-fed, automatic carbine designed
          to fire handgun cartridges. They are ideal for close-quarters battle
          (CQB) because they are a pistol-caliber weapon that's easy to control
          due to their reduced size, recoil and muzzle blast. SMGs are also less
          likely to over-penetrate the target. They also lend themselves to the
          use of suppressors, particularly when loaded with subsonic ammunition.
          Some variants have integral suppressors. SMGs are best suited to short
          to medium range engagements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Weapons in the SMG class come in a variety of calibers ranging from
          9mm to .45ACP and appear in both traditional and bullpup layouts. SMGs
          can be fitted with extended magazines as well as a range of
          attachments including including sights, fore-grips and muzzle
          attachments, like a suppressor.
