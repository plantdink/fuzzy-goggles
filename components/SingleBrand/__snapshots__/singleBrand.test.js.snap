        Strategic Homeland Division has approved multiple Brand manufacturers to supply equipment for SHD agents.
      </p>
      <p>
         There are also numerous non-approved Brands that an agent may find during the conduct of operations and agents are authorised to use any equipment they need in order to complete their mission.
      </p>
      <p>
         Each Brand provides different benefits to an agent and their ability to conduct operations.
      </p>
      <p>
         Equipping items from the same brand will unlock different benefits, with 3 equipped providing the maximum Brand-specific benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
         Agents are encouraged to mix and match Brands to provide the best benefit to their preferred operational style.
