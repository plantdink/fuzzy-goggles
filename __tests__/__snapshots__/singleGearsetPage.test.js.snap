          A Gear Set is a unique combination of equipment pieces that an Agent can obtain.
        </p>
        <p>
           Each Gear Set revolves around a specific operational capability and can strongly influence an agents overall approach to any situation they might face.
        </p>
        <p>
           Unlike a Brand set, the Chest and Backpack from a Gear Set do not have a specific Talent associated with them.
        </p>
        <p>
           Once a certain number of pieces of the same Gear Set are equipped, an agent will obtain various Set bonuses with all the bonuses available when four pieces are equipped.
        </p>
        <p>
           An agent must equip the Chest piece and Backpack in order to access the bonuses associated with each of these items.
