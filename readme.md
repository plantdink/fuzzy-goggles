Agent Field Manual is intended as a companion application for new agents in the world of Tom Clancy's The Division 2. It allows agents to quickly find and visualise different data about various game items.

## Project Description

This is a passion project designed to demonstrate full stack software engineering skills. It has allowed me to put into practice the entire process of creating a full stack application from the start with the concept and design, through to the implementation and creation, and ultimately to the deployment and maintenance.

I have been able to practice and see the end results of the decisions I made during each step of the process.

## Acknowledgements & Thanks

This project would not have been at all possible without the Division community. The list below includes some of the people who have spent their time collecting and collating data both in, and out of the game. Without them I would not have had the wealth of resources and data to draw from in order to make this application.

So from someone you have never met, many thanks.
